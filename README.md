dis_r_dis - Discover the maximum possible resolutions for an external display.
=============

What is dis_r_dis?
-----

It's a bash script that will try to DISCOVER THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE RESOLUTIONS (*) for 
an EXTERNAL display connected on NOTEBOOKS with a NVIDIA GPU (OPTIMUS 
TECHNOLOGY) and the HDMI port WIRED to the GPU!

(*) Resolutions that do not "crash" the display and keep its proportions!

NOTE: This script works with other GPUs since they can be configured with the commands ```cvt``` and ```xrandr```, however most of the tests we did was using a GPU with the above configurations mainly with regard to the condition HDMI port WIRED to the GPU!

How to use!
-----

Run with...

```
bash dis_r_dis.bash
```

... and the script will guide you through the process!

Have fun! =D
